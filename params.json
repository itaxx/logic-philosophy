I am a novice user of Git, and so will have to see if this is actually an effective strategy for collaboration. If anyone of the group is interested in experimenting with more Git's functionality, let me know. \r\n\r\nFor those that just wish to download the most recent version of the PDF file, they can find it [here](https://github.com/msteenhagen/logic-philosophy/blob/master/siderexercises.pdf?raw=true).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
